# Latin Accent 🦊

**Latin Accent** is a custom Firefox theme for Windows that enhances your browser with translucent UI surfaces and leverages your system’s **accent color** for a sleek, modern look. It's inspired by minimalist design trends while keeping things bold, personal, and responsive.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Open `about:profiles` in Firefox.
2. Locate the **Root Directory** of your active profile and open it.
3. Copy the `chrome` folder (from this repo) into that directory.  
   It must contain:
   - `userChrome.css`
   - `userContent.css`
4. (Optional) Copy `bonjour.json` to use with the Bonjour extension (see below).

## ⚙️ Enable Custom CSS in Firefox

Go to `about:config` and set the following preference to **true**:

```
toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
```

This allows Firefox to load your custom `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css`.


## 🪟 Enable Transparency – Windows

In `about:config`, set the following preferences to **true**:

```
layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled
widget.windows.mica
gfx.webrender.all
browser.tabs.allow_transparent_browser
```
## 🔍 Please note

Firefox does **not** support true transparency natively. To enable real translucent effects like in the previews, you'll need to use one of these third-party mods:

- [**Mica For Everyone**](https://github.com/rocksdanister/mica-for-everyone)  
- [**Translucent Windows (Windhawk mod)**](https://windhawk.net/mods/translucent-windows)

## 🧪 Optional – Custom New Tab Page with Bonjour

To match the full vibe, install the [**Bonjour**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bonjour-startpage/) extension and apply the custom config.

### Steps:

1. Install the **Bonjour** extension from Mozilla Add-ons.
2. Open Bonjour's settings → click **"Import Config"**.
3. Select the included `bonjour.json` file.
4. Your new tab page will now match the Latin Accent aesthetic.


## 💬 Notes

- Restart Firefox after installing or editing any styles.
- Some effects depend on OS-level features (e.g. Mica on Windows 11, vibrancy on macOS).
- Transparency effects may vary depending on your system theme and hardware acceleration settings.
